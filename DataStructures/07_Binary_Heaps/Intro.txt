There are two types:

Min Heap: The parent node is always smaller than or equal to its children.

Max Heap: The parent node is always greater than or equal to its children.

This means:

In a Min Heap, the smallest element is at the root.

In a Max Heap, the largest element is at the root.

A binary heap is a complete tree, meaning:

All levels are completely filled, except possibly the last level.

The last level is filled from left to right.
